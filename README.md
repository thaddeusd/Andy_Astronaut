# Andy_Astronaut
Game Maker 1.4 project

This is the source code for Andy the Astronaut. It's a game like Flappy Birds, except that you are an astronaut in space.
Why are there pillars on the moon? It doesn't matter. Dodge them and increase your score. Beware the Moon Shark!

This project provides a basic framework for any type of endless scroller possible. Imagination and technical skill are the only limits!
